There are many contributing factors that need to go into to building great software, having reliable processes in place that support a consistent development pace is a good place to start. Working environments that encourage teams to improve their ways of working to get better results, can really help introduce consistency, and quality into the codebase. Seeing successful results from this sort of thing can be both positive and aesthetically pleasing. However, there is another important contributing factor that goes into to building great software, and that is '_The ability to be able to recognise opportunities when they arise, and being agile enough to take advantage of them_'.

#  Initial Investment of Time
The initial investment of time, cost  and resources should be applied properly. Start by reviewing the requirements, then establish what the maximum amount of customer value that can be delivered using the minimum amount of work effort. This will produce quantifiable value immediately and will provide some early validation. The quickest way to do this is, ask the business to value their requirements relative to each other, then allow the team to estimate those items. After doing this, it will help with getting the bigger picture and understanding more about the scope from both; technical and business perspectives. Keep in mind that when the team do their estimations, avoid using absolute estimation (more on this topic in a separate article).

# Change is Inevitable
Most, if not all projects have their good and nasty surprises throughout their life-cycles, this can make delivering projects exciting, challenging and rewarding. But, that can often depend on how well 'change' can be dealt with.
Change is inevitable, in fact any project, in itself is just a mechanism to introduce change in some way or another.
One of the twelve agile manifesto principles states _'Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process'_, I don't think that this statement is necessarily solely referring to the change requirements related to the product or service. I think it also includes the changes that get introduced that improve the way we work, this often comes from the outcome of a Sprint Retrospective (or at least it should be!), or through regularly reflecting on progress. Being able to welcome change when it occurs, helps enable the ability to be adaptable when it counts.


# Where The Focus Should be
Delivering high quality value to the customers and end users should be the primary focus. It pays to actively seek feedback, and not just from stakeholders, customers and end users, but also from the team too. Getting this feedback early, and frequently will allow you, and the team to learn whilst enhancing your understanding of the problem that you're all trying to solve. Always be on the lookout to take advantage from what you can learn from feedback (improvement changes for the product or service), and from the Retrospectives (improvement changes in the way the team work), and then pivot to change your direction accordingly.


# Regularly Introduce Small Changes of Improvements
I spoke about this earlier, and I'm going to do it some more! Being able to effectively deal with change will soon show overtime that it can provide opportunities with positive outcomes, and limits the amount of re-work. It also aids towards revealing new opportunities when they appear. When you are regularly introducing small changes of improvements, then this makes 'change' itself easier to implement and adopt. Prime example, when a customer or Product Owner has a requirement that changes, or hasn't been clearly defined.

# Choosing the Sprint Cycles
I'd suggest trying to get those cycles between 2-3 weeks or less, as you want to shorten the feedback loop as much as possible. Plan to deliver work in vertical slices, i.e. shippable software at the end of each Sprint. That means that each vertical slice makes an independent user story, one that has pieces of layers in it that include: Database, API Logic, User Interface (UI). This forms together to become a fully functional feature. The planning, designing, testing and development all have to happen within the Sprint cycle. Therefore, make sure you choose the right Sprint cycles that is suitable for the scope, team and the organisation.

# Conclusion
Work closely with the customers and end users to gain early feedback, use the approach of taking the small steps in delivery using vertical slices, focus on allocating resources at the start to deliver high valued items using minimum effort, and welcome change. This should all help towards reducing risk and costs - ultimately, taking advantage of being agile will increase the chances of delivering on time, and within budget. Most importantly you'll be actually building the RIGHT product or service, one that suits the needs of the customers and end users. And when that happens, working on software projects become so much more enjoyable and rewarding.
