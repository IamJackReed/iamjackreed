I think it's quite evident that years ago in the 1940s and 50s, it was somewhat of a consumption economy driven period. Companies would build and produce products and services, and the customers would then purchase them. The products and services that were produced back then, in comparison to today's world, seem basic and almost rudimentary in design. Fast forward 40-50 years, and customers levels of expectation have gone through the roof and still on a constant rise. Companies competing with one another, each trying to portray their product or services as being something more, something better. This time customers aren't just purchasing a product or service, they're getting the brand and the experience that comes with it. This experience driven world is very much among us, I mean we can see it everywhere we look as there are leading groups of brands in almost every industry. When we associate ourselves with brands, it can provide us with an experience and a sense of belonging - as customers and end users, are our levels of expectancy starting to outgrow the experience driven economy? Are the levels of expectancy growing to an extent that we now no longer just want a quality product with an experience, we want more, we want to be part of it and control it!

Listed below are just 5 ways that through using an agile approach to delivery, can help keep up with the high expectancy levels of today's customers:

### Delivering The Right Thing Fast
The benchmark for producing any quality software in today's world is pretty high. It depends on being able to create and utilise a short feedback loop that is fed from various stakeholders, customers and end users. Implementing this feedback successfully will not only depend on having the right team in place, but also good guidance is required in order to form the development processes for the team to follow. Agile works best when there is flexibility coupled with lean processes, keeping what's essential and get rid of anything else! Less time, less work effort, fewer costs, and the ability to deliver FAST without compromising on quality!

### Taking Small Reversible Steps
Using engineering techniques such as '_Test-driven Development_' (TDD), can be a great example. This is where the first test that is written fails, which is the expected result when using TDD since the tests for the code are written before the code itself. This helps in many ways, one of them is that it avoids a lot of potential regression issues, and can be used over time to help build a reliable test suite. '_Pair Programming_' is another great example of a good engineering practice. This can be beneficial when there are new joiners to the team and they need to get up to speed. When delivering vertical slices (i.e. shippable software after each Sprint), it might be worth it to pair up back-end resources with the front end engineers to help ensure that full feature delivery is implemented correctly. Pair programming shouldn't be thought of as the work effort of 2 people, but as the avoided rework of 4 people.

### Increase Reliability
Customers and end users are becoming increasingly less tolerant of errors and crashes that can be found in software. Take mobile Apps for example, itâ€™s often the case where if a user has downloaded an App but it keeps freezing, fails to work, or is just incredibly slow, then the user will just end up deleting the App and start searching for another alternative. Using agile frameworks such as '_Scrum_', with its multiple cycles of building, testing and quality assurance, enables the App developers to build in more quality and reliability through planned repeated cycles of testing within each Sprint cycle.

### Responsive to Technology Changes
Desktop and mobile technology such as, new operating systems, existing feature updates and enhancements all move at an extremely fast pace. Being agile can help keep up with this by welcoming changes to the project and in turn takes advantage of having frequent releases, with the added ability to pivot and change focus (if/when necessary) at the end of each Sprint. As a result, this makes it easier for new updates and enhancements to be introduced into a LIVE production environment, and can be much more responsive to these types of technology changes.

### Iterating on Feedback
Combining the use of Sprints with the typical software update model of desktops and mobile Apps, means that comments about new features and enhancements gained from the feedback can be implemented easily. Agile enables the ability to keep a continuous process of iterating and updating, because the design, planning, development and testing (including against the compatibility of any old existing data) are all done within the Sprint cycle.

### Conclusion
Just to end with a few thoughts about quality:

- Quality shouldn't be an afterthought, think about quality from the get go. It should be getting baked in, not stuck on at the end.
- Never comprise on quality thinking it will save time, it always catches you up.
- Don't just iterate on the feedback from the customers and end users, remember to keep the feedback loop short, regular and consistent. It's no good providing the RIGHT solution at the WRONG time.
