The ability to effectively facilitate groups of individuals that are all fully engaged for making decisions collaboratively, is commonly recognised as being a fundamental skill for any Scrum Master and is a key element to the success of building a functional, high performing Scrum team - _Why is facilitation considered to be so important for a Scrum Master?_ _What are some of the challenges found in facilitating?_ _What might help with these challenges?_ These are some of the questions that I’ll be exploring. There are many parts to facilitation so I’ll cover parts that I think are worth mentioning. If you’re after more information about the topic of facilitation, then there are links at the bottom that will hopefully, be as useful to you as they have been for me.

I can’t emphasise enough on the importance of facilitation and if you’re a Scrum Master or an Agile Coach, you’ll only know too well. If you’re just starting out as a Scrum Master or considering it? Then I’d highly recommend engaging within the Scrum community for more information on this topic (or indeed for most Scrum related topics). Generally, the Scrum community are a nice bunch to mix with and they like sharing experiences and knowledge, these practical perspectives can be extremely useful.

#### Facilitation Isn't Easy
No doubt, you’ve seen great facilitation outside of the world of Agile. If you have ever been in a meeting, workshop, or any kind of group gathering that went smoothly with a successful outcome, perhaps even thought to yourself afterwards ‘_Well, that was easy_’. If so, then there is a good chance that it had a good facilitator that made it feel easy. After all, the word ‘_facil_’ in Spanish translates to ‘_easy_’, deriving from the Latin word ‘_facilis_’. That’s not to say facilitation is easy- it’s not. One of the things I’ve discovered since being a Scrum Master is that the journey towards becoming a good facilitator- is one of the biggest challenges found in communication and collaboration.

#### Collaboration Is Nothing New
You’ll often hear the word ‘_collaborate_’, being said in software development. But what does ‘_collaborate_’ mean? I think, in the bluntest sense it just means ‘_work together_’. Which is nothing new of course, since we’ve been working collectively in groups since the beginning of our existence, and to a large extent our ability to collaborate has contributed towards our success as a species.

'_Only by working together are we able to fully account for the emergence and timing of unique features of Homo sapiens and how humans, evolved through natural processes, resulted in a spectacular anomaly among living species_.' - **Kim Hill** (professor anthropologist)

It may seem obvious to have groups of people working together in a team to accomplish something that would be otherwise difficult if everyone acted as separate individuals, and it might also seem logical for a team to practice as a team so that they can improve working together over time. Take sports teams, for example, they all typically spend hours of their time practising together to improve how they work as a team. In the British Army (and most likely all armies), small teams of soldiers (sections) practically collaborate constantly, to accomplish their objectives. They use terms such as ‘_mucking in_’, instead of ‘_collaborating_’, and often refer to someone as ‘_jacking_’, when they’re not collaborating. But essentially, they’re working together and typically improve how they work together over time.

One of the main reasons why, I think, collaboration is heard and echoed so much in software development today is that the success of software is usually based on the outcome that occurs after it’s been shipped. This means that it becomes paramount, not only for individuals on a team to collaborate but also for those at the team level to collaborate with their organisations higher strategic objectives, as well as with customers and users to understand their needs and challenges. Generally speaking, any Agile team that collaborates well, keeps their work transparent and has effective facilitation can advantage of making effective decisions that are driven by the collective knowledge of the team. By collaborating they can make decisions about their work and their commitment that is based on their abilities. This type of transparency coupled with good communication and effective facilitation, helps each individual on the team align collectively to focus their efforts on a single point, for example, building a valuable solution for users, or completing a Sprint goal.

#### Good Communication Is Essential
My overall view is that collaborating depends heavily on trust, but also good communication amongst a team, having a free flow of meaning in conversations allows for a better understanding of each other's perspectives, ideas and opinions. If individuals of a team find it difficult to communicate with one another, then that’s when the wheels start falling off and it’s very likely, that it will impact their agility and effectiveness as a team.

'_Most Conversations Are Simply Monologues Delivered in the Presence of a Witness'_- **Margaret Millar** (perhaps, **Mark Twain**?!)

The need for good communication and collaboration are clear. Being a facilitator can help with promoting and nurturing a safe environment for communication, which is a must for any type of Agile team. This probably all sounds obvious and straight forward. However, what isn’t always obvious, are the types of obstacles (impediments) that prevent communication from working effectively and how facilitation can help, which I’ll come back to in a minute.

#### Scrum Master Facilitation Is Not..
I recently read an interesting article by [Tobias Mayer](http://tobiasmayer.uk/), that explores the topic of collaboration. In this article ([Collaboration: the art of letting go](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaboration-art-letting-go-tobias-mayer/)), Tobias explores this topic and doesn’t start with an explanation to what he thinks collaboration is- instead, he starts by offering specific examples of what collaboration is NOT. Perhaps, when it comes to exploring something that is commonly misunderstood or misused, then it might be better for us to start with first, defining what that ‘something’ isn’t. After all, we’re probably more likely to understand and resonate with something that we already recognise.

_'It is far from easy, and there is a great deal of mind-trickery that tells us we are collaborating when in fact we are coercing, manipulating, managing, shaping, colluding, controlling, seeking compliance and perhaps even sulking to get our own way. True collaboration is a rare bird of paradise, seldom seen, and when discovered often shot._'- **Tobias Mayer**

Starting my Scrum Master journey from being a Project Manager in software development and a Paratrooper before that, I have had to adjust quite a bit in terms of my mindset and what I originally thought a good facilitator should be doing. In the journey of me transitioning, I have learnt that facilitation for a Scrum Master is NOT:

- Typing and updating tickets in JIRA, Pivotal Tracker, or any other kind of software tool.
- Solely about facilitating at the team level, but also the Product Owner and those at the wider Organisation level.
- Telling a Scrum team what tools, techniques, methodologies and practices they should be using (suggestions for a team new to Scrum is fine).
- Being the one standing at the front and demonstrating the completed work during a Sprint Review.
- Creating a list of actions for a Scrum team based on your own interpretation of collected data from a Sprint during a Retrospective.
- Preaching about what it says in 'The Scrum Guide'.
- Assigning tasks to members of the Scrum team.
- Being known as the note taker for the Scrum team.
- Just chit-chatting about the teams' feelings during a Retrospective.
- Running Daily Scrums as if there were report meetings.
- Telling the Scrum team what their plan should be for improving.
- Have I mentioned what it says in the 'The Scrum Guide?'

The ‘_Scrum Master facilitation_' is NOT preaching about what it says in ‘_The Scrum Guide_’, I’d go as far in saying that I’d avoid dropping the words ‘The Scrum Guide’ or even ‘Agile’, from most interactions at work. Particularly when you’re trying to get a point across or explain something. That goes for the Scrum team, Product Owner or someone within the organisation and especially stakeholders. In my experience, nothing falls quicker on deaf ears than a preaching Scrum Master reciting words from a 19-page guide book. Instead, I’d recommend using a real-life example, some kind of story, a form of metaphor or analogy.

#### Neutral Position
Being a good facilitator is the bread and butter for any Scrum Master, part of the role is to service the Product Owner and Development Team by ‘Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed’. Which sounds straight forward and in theory, it is since the outcomes from each of Scrum event in the Scrum Guide are clear. However, what I find interesting about the ‘_Scrum Master facilitation is NOT solely about facilitating at the team level, but also the Product Owner and those at the wider Organisation level_’, is that there are many circumstances when a Scrum Master might want to experiment and facilitate in a slightly different way (not just in the Scrum events), perhaps to incorporate a new, different activity or method to help reach a wider audience or to achieve a better outcome. I don’t see there being anything wrong in getting feedback on this either. I mean, in the spirit of modelling positive behaviour shouldn’t the act of experimentation be recognised as being part of a pragmatic approach to your efforts in becoming better in your role, isn’t that what you’d expect from a team too?

Scrum Masters shouldn’t just be facilitating the Scrum events, occasionally they will get asked to help facilitate something for the organisation, which could entail considerations such as:

- What are the desired outcomes?
- Who will be attending (C-Levels, Stakeholders, Investors)?
- Will any attendees be attending remotely?
- What are the attendees' expectations?
- Who needs to know the results of the outcome?
- Where will it be held?
- What is the expected duration?

In addition to the Scrum events, what I think facilitation for a Scrum Master SHOULD be about:

- Ice-breaking activities for new teams or members.
- Integrating multiple frames of references.
- Nurturing relationships between team members, Product Owner and others within the organisation.
- Guiding structured discussions about product and processes.
- Assisting the team in divergent and convergent thinking.
- Aiding with conflict resolution.
- Group decision-making.
- Internal and external collaboration meetings.
- Applying basic ground rules in facilitation.
- Integrating Scrum into the organisation.

For me, facilitating as a Scrum Master is about staying in a neutral position, understanding the desired outcome of each event and being able to smoothly transition the team from A to B whilst keeping things on track, encouraging conversations to flow without letting things deviate too much from the desired outcome.

#### Facilitating Scrum Events
Some great examples of the type of characteristics that each Scrum event should have, I like what '_**Barry Overeem**_' offers in his post [The Scrum Master As A Facilitator](http://www.barryovereem.com/the-scrum-master-as-a-facilitator/). He describes the characteristics of well-facilitated Scrum events:
- **The Daily Scrum** contains an atmosphere where healthy peer pressure occurs on delivery quality, commitment and addressing impediments;
- **The Sprint Planning** is all about collaboration between the Product Owner and the Development team and has a strong focus on delivering business value. All team members understand the work and jointly agree to achieve the sprint goal;
- **The Sprint Review** is an energising event in which the Scrum team, sponsors and stakeholders together inspect the product increment and backlog. But also retrospect their collaboration and how this can be improved. They act as one team with the same purpose, there are no barriers between ‘client’ and ‘supplier’;
- **The Retrospective** is done in a safe atmosphere in which ‘the elephant in the room’ is addressed, discussed and turned into actionable improvements that the team members agree upon realising in the next sprint.

#### Psychological Environment
Coming back to ‘what isn’t always obvious are the types of obstacles (impediments) that prevent communication from working effectively and how facilitation can help’- one of the main challenges is usually the environment from a psychological perspective, it has to be psychologically safe. Not just that, if the culture of the organisation suffers from dysfunctions that diminish the levels of trust and respect needed for truthful conversations, then it is likely that part of this will have trickled down into the team layer level and could be embedded within the Scrum team. If that’s the case, then team members might not want to risk communicating what they think. I mean, who wants to suggest an idea and get laughed at, or not be taken seriously? Is it easier for team members to just to succumb to the HIPPO (highest paid person's opinion) in the room, or conform to the most dominant member of the team for the sake of ease and conflict avoidance?

_'Positive emotions like trust, curiosity, confidence, and inspiration broaden the mind and help us build psychological, social, and physical resources. We become more open-minded, resilient, motivated, and persistent when we feel safe. Humour increases, as does solution-finding and divergent thinking — the cognitive process underlying creativity_'.- **Barbara L. Fredrickson**

#### Physical Environment
Another impediment that could be preventing effective communication might be physically related, for example, air conditioning of the rooms, room size, lack of natural daylight, external noises and interferences, etc. Having distributed team members can also present challenges, although this might work well for some, others (probably most) find this difficult due to differences in time zones, lag time between responses and loss of information that usually gets subtly conveyed when speaking with someone face to face.

#### Biases & Negative Attitudes
Other impediments might be found more in the context of conversations, for example, the surfacing of preconceived notions, negative attitudes, assumptions, inferences and biases can all make achieving the desired outcome as a team difficult. I try and ‘_spot the biases_’, almost like a game that I play in my head. I consciously try and make an effort to be more attentive and aware of any judgements being made that are based on personal points of view (including my own). I observe and listen out for biases in conversations and in the decisions that are being made. To do this has meant that I have had to constantly remind myself, to be quiet and listen more, sometimes resist breaking silence (usually at the very point at which I want to speak up or intervene). For anyone who has ever met me, will know, that this is an achievement of itself. Here are a few biases that I typically come across or have otherwise just found interesting:

- **Status quo bias** The tendency to like things to stay relatively the same.
- **The empathy gap** The tendency to underestimate the influence or strength of feelings, in either oneself or others.
- **Confirmation bias** The tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms one's pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.
- **IKEA effect** The tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end result.
- **Irrational escalation** The tendency to refer to a situation in which people can make irrational decisions based upon rational decisions in the past or to justify actions already taken.
- **Dunning–Kruger effect** The tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability and the tendency for experts to underestimate their own ability.
- **Focusing effect** The tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event.
- **Framing effect** The tendency to react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented.
- **Social desirability** The tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favourably by others.
- **Courtesy bias** The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, to avoid offending anyone.
- **Knowledge bias** The tendency to unknowingly assume that the others have the background to understand.
- **The illusion of control** The tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over other external events.
- **Planning fallacy** The tendency to underestimate task-completion times.

Not to worry too much about biases. I mean, we all have them at times and the science on this is clear- if you’re a human, then your brain operates through biases. Being aware and making the team aware of biases, assumptions (taking for granted things that are true, that have not yet been verified) and inferences (making a conclusions about things that are not known, based on something that is known), can help towards making sure that ‘value’ stays defined by the customer and that pointless, expensive, full-on features that are built just because we all assumed that we knew what the customer wanted. As a rule of thumb, in software development- customers don’t know what they want, they know what they want once you show to them.

#### Team Dysfunctions
By being that somebody (the facilitator) that’s in a neutral position, you’re in a far better position to be able to; observe the behaviours and interactions of the team, notice how each member communicates and whether they’re collaborating. Working on identifying and rectifying team dysfunctions based on **Patrick Lencioni's** - [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni/dp/0787960756), if you're not already doing so, I've found that it's a good place to start:

- **Absence of Trust**
- **Fear of Conflict**
- **Lack of Commitment**
- **Avoidance of Accountability**
- **Inattention to Results**

#### Language Difficulties (言語の問題)
There can be impediments associated with languages difficulties, regional dialects or proficiency in a certain language. Using jargon or slang words can sometimes be confusing for some people due to generation gaps. Not having enough common experiences can also limit somebody’s understanding of a discussion, especially if there are a lot of stories or examples that are frequently being used to convey information.

#### Conclusion
Being able to work as a team successfully will often come down to how well individuals on that team respond to the methods that the team are using to work together- these methods ideally should be reviewed and evaluated by the team regularly. To avoid biases and encourage engagement from everyone on the team to make effective group decisions, having someone in a neutral position to effectively facilitate this, helps ensure a smooth process and generally a much better outcome.

Having some basic ground rules when it comes to facilitating can help promote positive behaviours that should improve overall group discussions. These basic ground rules can act as a modelling tool to exhibit desired group behaviour, they can also help with knowing when to intervene as a facilitator, as you’re able to identify negative behaviours and general unhelpful group behaviour within the team- examples of some basic ground rules include:

- Test assumptions and Inferences.
- Keeps things transparent.
- Be specific.
- Explain reasoning and intent.
- Focus on the interests rather than positions (solutions).
- Combining advocacy and inquiry.
- Decisions should be made by the team.
- Agree to address (if necessary) any uncomfortable issues.
- Always strive to improve your facilitation skills.

Remember to get feedback on your facilitation, why not? Much like how a good agile team operates through the transparency of their work, inspecting product feedback and their processes regularly, then adapting to make improvements over time.
